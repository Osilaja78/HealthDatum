                    Welcome to <b>HealthDatum</b>, your no.1 EHR system that provides 
                    easy means of managing clinical data. Thanks for being part of the community ðŸ¥°.

                <p>
                    Now that you're registered, the next thing is to wait while your 
                    clinic gets verified by our system, so you can have full access to our product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You don't have to do anything at this stage, verification usually take at least 
                    24 hours. Once your clinic is successfully verified, you'll recieve further 
                    instructions on how to access or platform.
